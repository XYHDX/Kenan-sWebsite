This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Image Storage Configuration

This project uses Upstash Redis for storing images as Base64-encoded data URLs. This approach:

1. Stores images directly in Redis
2. Serves images through a dynamic API route
3. Allows file uploads to work in serverless environments without filesystem access

### Limitations:

- Image size limit: 2MB per image
- Best for smaller images and cases (dental before/after photos)
- Using the Redis database for image storage is suitable for small to medium sites

### Alternative Storage Solutions:

For larger production sites or high-volume image storage, consider:
- Amazon S3
- Cloudinary
- Vercel Blob Storage
- Other dedicated object storage services

No additional configuration is required as the project already uses Upstash Redis for other data storage.
